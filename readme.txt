In terms of the functionality of this app, I was able to get it to map the dinosaurs from the dinosaurs.json file onto the card divs. What I was unable to do was make it so the images would shuffle after being clicked, which is an important mechanic of the game. I have the shuffle code set up with the dinosaurs array theoretically being shuffled, but that's about it. To get it to shuffle properly, I would have to add a setState() function that would set the dinosaurs array to be what it was shuffled to be. This setState function would have to be before the "return array;" so that it actually sets the state before the array is returned. 
For the next part of functionality, I would have to make the player earn points if they click a card that has not been clicked yet. To do this, I could have the card ID that is clicked added to an array and +1 given to the player's score before the cards reshuffle. If the player clicks a card that was already added to the array, it would give game over, the cards would reshuffle, the score would be set back to zero, and the array containing the clicked cards would be cleared using "clickedCards = [];"
I believe the code to check if a card has already been added to clickedcards would work using the "array[i].indexOf(clicked card)" method.
lastly, the highscore functionality would be achieved by, during game over, "if score > highscore set highscore = score" before the score is set back to zero.
